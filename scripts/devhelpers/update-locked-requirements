# Usage:

# 1. To add new dependencies, just add an unpinned version to the
# `production.in` (or `dev.in`) file, and simply run this script.

# 2. To update an existing dependency, remove the corresponding entry from the
# output file 2_rsr.txt or 3_dev.txt, and run this script.

# NOTE: Currently, most of the dependencies are listed with their locked
# versions in the *.in files, since we are transitioning from old requirements
# files. As, and when we update packages or change them, we would unpin them, if
# possible.
