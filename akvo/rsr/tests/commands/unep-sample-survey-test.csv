The use of non-incineration technologies also provide for the opportunity to recycle disinfected waste fractions, in particular plastics, and allow model healthcare facilities in project countries to reduce their costs for waste treatment, by selling plastics to recyclers. Examples from project countries on engagement with plastics recycling industry are as follows:  o	The project in Madagascar has implemented the collection of recyclable plastics at all five model healthcare facilities (HFCs) and facilitated HFC’s engagement with recycling companies in Antananarivo. The university hospital in Antananarivo, CHU JRB Befelatanana, currently produces pavers from recycling of disinfected (autoclaved) plastics.  o	The project in Tanzania focuses on the recycling of plastic that was previously infectious, rather than recovering recyclable materials from the general waste stream. All five model HCFs in Dar es Salaam produces blocks of disinfected plastics. The project identified a plastic recycling facility in Mbagala that will collect the plastic blocks from the HCFs, including Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, and transport these to their sorting facility; the facilities will receive 500 TSH per kg for plastic (0.22 USD/kg).  o	The project in Zambia already initiated recycling activities by recovering recyclable plastics from the general waste stream. The local recycling company, Waste Master (Z), currently works with three model HFCs in Lusaka, University Teaching Hospital (UTH), Chilenje and Matero Level 1 Hospitals. The model HCFs supplying Waste Master (Z) in Lusaka receive about 1.15 kwacha per kg of mixed plastics (0.08 USD/kg).   o	In Zambia, the project also initiated a demonstration activity, as an example of closed loop recycling of plastic waste, on the local production of high quality sharp waste containers from recycled plastics from disinfected plastics from model HFCs in Lusaka, but the activity was cancelled due to high cost proposals from private sector.","TECHNOLOGY and PROCESSES: New technical developments/innovation (e.g., research and development, new product design, new materials, processes etc.) changes in practice, operations, environmental management and planning.",,,,,,,,,,,Change in operations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g., education, training, communication, awareness raising, behaviour change programmes)",I/We are implementing it,,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (organisations concerned with government policies and programmes),,National ministry/agency,,,,,,Yes,Reporting is voluntary,,,,Yes,,Regional (UN Regions),,"Ghana,Madagascar,United Republic of Tanzania,Zambia",,"Urban environment,Waste disposal sites",,Collection / sorting of plastics after use,,Recycling plastics,,Human health and wellbeing,,Not applicable,,,,,,Medical,,6453195,USD,28936164,USD,Not applicable,,GEF,Continuous activity more than 3 Years long,,I have no link to provide,,,,,,,2020-01-23 20:48:23 UTC,2020-01-23 20:56:14 UTC

Race for Water Foundation promotes the review of current methods in place for plastic production and urge everyone to reduce their plastic consumption and recycle their plastic waste. But the fragility of the current recycling model hinders its development.    In anticipation of a circular plastic economy that is sustainable and environmentally friendly, Race for Water presents a realistic solution that, deployed on a large scale, can reduce drastically the contamination of the oceans from plastic waste. We offer high temperature pyrolysis technology developed to transform all plastic waste into electricity.  These units installed in containers can be installed close to inhabited areas and allow even isolated communities, such as islands, to manage their waste management and their energy  production independently. The income generated by the sale of electricity provides a source of remuneration to pay street collectors and a reduction in waste disposal costs. The value  generated directly benefits local communities, be it on an economic, social or environmental level.    We currently have a showroom in France where interested stakeholders can discover the unit in operation.   At the same time, a series of “Proof of Concept” projects are currently under study to showcase the business model, the social benefits and the positive environmental impact of the plastic waste to energy value chain in strategic places: islands, rivers and coastal cities.    By 2025, we are keen for our model to be replicated worldwide so as to have a sustainable impact on the planet.",2020-01-27 10:00:30 UTC,2020-01-27 11:12:43 UTC
