{% blocktrans %}Your mobile number, {{phone_number}}, has been added to your user profile. This will let you send updates to your projects via SMS.

To ensure that all works as it should we ask that you validate the phone by sending the following code:

{{validation}}

An SMS from Akvo RSR has been sent to you. Please reply to the SMS with the validation code only.
If the SMS didn't reach you for some reason you sent the validation code to:

{{gw_number}}

Then all you have to do is log in to Akvo and select the project(s) you want to enable SMS updates for.
