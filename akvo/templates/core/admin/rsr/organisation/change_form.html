Your audience may include people unfamiliar with the sector or with your sphere of operation, so a bit of explanation in plain language (no acronyms) might be helpful. Details will help viewers get a sense of who you are: do you work on all continents? In both water and sanitation, perhaps even with other goals in mind? Are you part of a network or programme?
