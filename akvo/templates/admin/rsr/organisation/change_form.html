    <h2>Adding and Editing Organisations.</h2>
    <p>Describe your organisation to the international Akvo community of users: tell us who you are, what you do, and what you as an organisation hope to accomplish. Your audience may include people unfamiliar with the sector or with your sphere of operation, so a bit of explanation in plain language (no acronyms) might be helpful. Details will help viewers get a sense of who you are: do you work on all continents? In both water and sanitation, perhaps even with other goals in mind? Are you part of a network or programme? </p>
