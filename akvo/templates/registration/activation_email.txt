Someone, hopefully you, signed up for a new account at {{site}} using this email address. If it was you, and you'd like to activate and use your account, click the link below or copy and paste it into your web browser's address bar:

https://{{site}}{{registration_activate_url}}

Note: After you have activated your account, we will review your application and possibly contact you to ensure that the account was created correctly, before the account is enabled. When you are ready to connect with your organisation, you can do so via Akvo RSR website or Akvo RSR mobile application, which you can download from Google Play Store.

If you didn't request this, you don't need to do anything and you won't receive any more email from us.
