Welcome to the online M&E environment of Aqua for All. Aqua for All is using a web-based monitoring and reporting system of the organization Akvo, which is linked to the so called ‘Akvo RSR’ system. If you are approached by Akvo, this will be done on behalf of Aqua for All. Your online user role is that of an enumerator meaning that you can (collect and) provide the agreed monitoring data.

Being the appointed enumerator of a project means, that we expect that you are the person in charge to provide the agreed monitoring data. Let us know if someone else needs to be assigned.

Once you have activated your account you will have restricted access to the Akvo RsR project page of your contracted project. By clicking the Title link to the project you will access a project page meant to provide you with an overview of the M&E status of your project. At this point no direct action is needed from your side. When you still have to submit baseline data, please do this in the “M&E indicator framework” Excel format and send this to your Aqua for All program manager via email.

When your contracted reporting moment is due, you will receive a new link to a webform via your registered email address. Here you can fill in your indicator results (progress or endline data). Once these results are submitted and approved, you can find them on this Akvo RsR project page. There is also an “Update” section. You are not required to post an update but you are most certainly welcome to do so.

Please click the following link to activate your account and start using Akvo RSR:
