# Memory Leak Analysis: 2025-08-27 02:30:00 to 08:30:00

## Time Window Summary
- **Period**: August 27, 2025, 02:30-08:30 UTC (6 hours)
- **Analysis Status**: Early monitoring period - leak patterns emerging
- **Critical Events**: First significant memory leak events detected near end of window

## Memory Leak Events Analysis

### Major Leak Events Detected
Based on Memory Leak Events (1h) data:

**End of Window (07:30-08:15):**
- **rsr-reports service**:
  - 07:30: First 10MB growth event (11.19 MB/h growth rate)
  - 07:45: Continued 10MB growth (62.22 MB/h growth rate)
  - 08:00: Sustained 10MB growth (109.09 MB/h growth rate)

- **rsr-backend service**:
  - 08:00: Multiple threshold breaches
    - 10MB growth: 43.30 MB/h
    - 50MB growth: 11.40 MB/h  
    - 100MB growth: 2.18 MB/h
  - 08:15: Escalated growth rates
    - 10MB growth: 69.24 MB/h
    - 50MB growth: 15.56 MB/h
    - 100MB growth: 4.50 MB/h

### Container Memory Usage Patterns

**rsr-backend processes:**
- Multiple backend instances (rsr-backend.1 through rsr-backend.609)
- Memory range: 2,000-2,200 MB per process
- Gradual increase observed throughout 6-hour window
- Total backend memory consumption: ~1.3TB across all processes

**rsr-reports service:**
- Memory range: 400-500 MB
- Shows concerning growth pattern in final hours
- Growth rate acceleration: 11.19 â†’ 62.22 â†’ 109.09 MB/h

**Supporting services:**
- rsr-memcached: ~8.8 MB (stable)
- rsr-nginx: ~82-84 MB (stable)
- cloudsql-proxy: ~8-10 MB (stable)

## Key Observations

### ðŸ”´ Critical Findings
1. **Memory leak acceleration**: Both backend and reports services show exponential growth patterns
2. **Threshold breaches**: All configured thresholds (10MB, 50MB, 100MB) exceeded simultaneously
3. **Service correlation**: Both primary application containers affected simultaneously

### ðŸŸ¡ Warning Signs
1. **Massive process count**: 609 backend processes suggests possible process proliferation
2. **Linear memory growth**: Steady increase in memory usage throughout monitoring period
3. **Late-window escalation**: Most severe leaks occur in final 45 minutes

### âœ… Stable Components
1. **Infrastructure services**: nginx, memcached, cloudsql-proxy remain stable
2. **Early period behavior**: First 5 hours show controlled memory usage

## Recommendations for Further Investigation

1. **Focus on 07:30-08:15 timeframe**: Identify application events triggering memory leak acceleration
2. **Examine rsr-reports service**: High growth rate (109 MB/h) warrants immediate attention  
3. **Backend process management**: Investigate why 609 backend processes are running
4. **Cross-reference logs**: Correlate memory spikes with application events, API calls, or background jobs

## Next Analysis Priority
The subsequent time window (08:30-14:30) should be analyzed to determine if leak patterns continue or stabilize.
