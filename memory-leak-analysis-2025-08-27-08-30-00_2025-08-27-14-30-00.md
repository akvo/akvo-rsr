# Memory Leak Analysis: 2025-08-27 08:30:00 to 14:30:00

## Time Window Summary
- **Period**: August 27, 2025, 08:30-14:30 UTC (6 hours)
- **Analysis Status**: Peak memory leak period with severe escalation
- **Critical Events**: Sustained high-growth events throughout window

## Memory Leak Events Analysis

### Severe Leak Events - Full Window
**Continuous memory leak events detected across entire 6-hour period**

#### rsr-backend Service Memory Growth
**Peak Growth Periods:**
- **08:30-09:30**: Extremely high growth rates
  - 100MB growth: 4.5-8.4 MB/h (continuous breach)
  - 50MB growth: 15.6-28.1 MB/h (sustained)  
  - 10MB growth: 69.2-126.5 MB/h (critical)

- **11:00-14:15**: Extended leak period
  - Consistent 10MB growth: 28-199 MB/h
  - 50MB growth: 4-37 MB/h
  - Final spike at 14:15: **199.6 MB/h** (10MB threshold)

#### rsr-reports Service Memory Growth
**Catastrophic Growth Pattern:**
- **Sustained high growth**: 89-461 MB/h throughout window
- **Peak at 14:15**: **461.5 MB/h** (most severe recorded)
- **Average growth rate**: ~250 MB/h across 6 hours

### View-Level Memory Growth Analysis

From Memory Growth Rate data, specific API endpoints showing memory leaks:

**High-Impact Endpoints:**
- `indicatorperioddata-list`: 0.09-0.59 MB/h growth
- `project-directory`: 0.34-1.09 MB/h growth  
- `project_results_framework`: 0.20-0.39 MB/h growth
- `project-list`: 0.66 MB/h sustained growth
- `py-reports-project-overview-pdf-report`: 2.1-3.4 MB/h growth

**Concerning Patterns:**
- Multiple project-related endpoints show memory growth
- Reports generation endpoints exhibit highest per-endpoint growth
- List endpoints consistently leak memory across monitoring period

## Critical Observations

### ðŸ”´ URGENT - System Critical
1. **rsr-reports service**: Growth rate of 461 MB/h is unsustainable
2. **Backend service**: Multiple threshold breaches simultaneously  
3. **No recovery periods**: Continuous growth with no memory cleanup
4. **Exponential acceleration**: Growth rates increasing throughout window

### ðŸŸ¡ High Priority Concerns
1. **API endpoint leaks**: Multiple REST API endpoints contributing to growth
2. **PDF report generation**: Major contributor to reports service leaks
3. **Project data operations**: Several project-related endpoints leaking memory

### Pattern Analysis
1. **Leak persistence**: Memory growth continues from previous window
2. **Service correlation**: Both backend and reports services affected simultaneously
3. **API-driven**: Growth correlates with specific endpoint usage patterns

## Memory Growth Trajectory

**rsr-reports Growth Progression:**
- 08:30: 109 MB/h â†’ 08:45: 175 MB/h â†’ 09:00: 132 MB/h
- Mid-period sustaining: 200-350 MB/h  
- 14:15 peak: 461 MB/h

**rsr-backend Growth Progression:**
- Early period: 60-126 MB/h (10MB threshold)
- Mid-period stabilization: 28-49 MB/h
- Final acceleration: 199 MB/h at 14:15

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Emergency investigation** of rsr-reports service memory management
2. **API endpoint analysis** for project-related operations
3. **PDF generation review** - likely major leak source
4. **Memory profiling** of indicatorperioddata and project_results_framework endpoints

## Risk Assessment
**CRITICAL**: Current growth rates will exhaust system resources within hours. Immediate intervention required to prevent service outage.

## Next Window Priority
The following window (14:30-20:30) analysis is critical to determine if the 461 MB/h peak growth rate continues or if there's system recovery.
