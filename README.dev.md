# RSR Docker Development Environment

## System setup

1. Install `docker`
2. Install `docker-compose`

## Starting Up

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr.git && cd akvo-rsr`

2. Run `docker-compose up --build`

3. Visit [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)

## Development

### Code Linting

We run lint checks on CI. To run them locally, you can run the
following command:

```sh
docker-compose exec -u akvo web ./scripts/devhelpers/lint.sh
```

### Tests

When the local server is running, you can run the following command in a
separate terminal to run the tests.

```sh
docker-compose exec web ./scripts/docker/dev/run-as-user.sh python manage.py test -k -v 3 akvo.rsr.tests.test_templatetags
```

- `-v` makes the output of the tests verbose
- `-k` keeps the database between consecutive test runs, so that migrations
  needn't be run each time (which take a long time!)

### Front-end assets

Front-end assets are managed by webpack. For production deployments, webpack
builds the assets required. For development, we automatically run a webpack
watcher that rebuilds anything that needs to be.

### Performance improvements

As the data in RSR is growing, we will discover code paths that are slow, and
can be optimized. The fixes are usually small - a few missing `select_related`
and `prefetch_related` calls. But, how do we go about finding out why a
particular page is slow to load, or an API endpoint is slow to respond?

The [Django Debug Toolbar](#django-debug-toolbar) along with the Network tab of
the Developer console will take you a long way in solving performance issues.

#### Network tab - Developer Console

The developer console can help you see coarsely, the amount of time each request from the page takes.  If a page has multiple API requests to fetch the relevant data, you could identify which one takes the longest, etc., from here.

#### Django debug toolbar

The Django Debug Toolbar(DDT) comes with a bunch of panels to display
information about the currently displayed view, a bunch of information being
quite useful to debug performance issues.

You can enable/configure it in `50-docker-local-dev.conf`.

##### Debugging performance issues

The Time, SQL and Cache panel are particularly of interest when debugging
performance related issues.

**NOTE**: All the information takes into account only the actions performed
within the Django view being used to render the current page. None of the AJAX
requests on that page are included into the statistics displayed by DDT.

##### Debugging slow AJAX calls

DDT is quite effective in finding reasons for slowness within the view that's
rendering the current page, but apparently not very helpful for debugging
performance issues within the AJAX calls made on the page. How do we debug
these?

- First, use the [Network tab of the Developer
  console](#network-tab---developer-console) to figure out which AJAX calls are
  slowing things down.

- Then, use the Django Debug Toolbar on the Django Rest Framework UI! For the
  slow request identified above, right click and copy the URL and open it in a
  new tab, without the `format=json` or `format=xml` argument to load up the DRF
  UI. If you have DDT enabled, it should show up on this page with the
  statistics for the end-point in question.

- Debug and improve performance

- Profit!

## Development Workflow

We use a branch and PR based development model.

- `develop` branch is the default branch of the repository. Any new commits on
  this branch are deployed to the test server, automatically.

- `master` branch is used for deployments to the live server. Any new commits to
  master are automatically deployed to the live server.

- Any code being committed onto `develop` should go through a pull-request and
  code-review process.

- Any code being committed to the `master` branch should go through a "release
  process".

### Git branches workflow

- Create a new branch for every issue/feature you are working on.

- Name the branch `feature/1234-featurename` where #1234 is the issue number

- When you have code ready to be merged, create a Pull Request from the Branch
  to merge into `develop`.

- Make commits in the format:

    [#1234] Fix problem with broken dependencies

  This will ensure the commits are "linked" to the issues.

  When an issue is completely fixed, add `Fixes #1234` in the commit message, to
  automatically close the issue when the PR is merged.

## Release Process

- Make sure all the issues going into this release are in a Milestone, are
  closed and have appropriate tags - bug, chore or feature-request.

- Create a draft release in [GitHub](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr/releases)

- Run `scripts/devhelpers/release_notes.py` to get a draft version of the
  release notes.

- Copy them over to GitHub and iterate on them.

- Set a [Status page announcement](https://akvo.statuspage.io/) to let our users
  know about the release

- Add the next version tag on `develop` and publish the release.

- Send a PR to `master` from `develop` and merge when the time is right!

## i18n Translations

### Process

- Add the tags to all strings within RSR that should be translated
- Generate the .po file from Django (`python manage.py makemessages`)
- Upload the .po file into the [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) interface
- Select the languages to be supported with the translations
- Assign translators to a language, assuring that every language is covered
- Translators perform the work and submit the translated strings into transifex
- Ensure all languages completed and approved
- Download the new .po files for each language
- Add these into the RSR Codebase
- Run `python manage.py compilemessages` to generate `.mo` files from the `.po`
  files, which are used by Django's built-in gettext support.

This process works the same way whether for RSR or for RSR Up - however for Up,
we do not use .po files but an alternative Android format, the process otherwise
remains the same.

### Notes for developers

When tagging for translation there are some things that will make life a lot
easier for translators.

* Avoid " (double quotes) within a string marked for translation. Use ' (single
  quotes) where ever possible instead since " is escaped to \" in the .po file.
  This gotcha is common when HTML tags are part of the translation string.
  Example, write:

```html
By <a href='{{ register1_url }}'>registering</a> with Akvo, you will be able to:
```

* Keep text in {% blocktrans %} on one line, including the blocktrans tag
  itself. This is because otherwise all the whitespace is included in the
  translation text. This is especially painful if combined with tabs for
  indenting.

* Use dictionaries for string interpolation with dict keys that explain the
  meaning of the inserted value. This also allows for re-ordering of the
  inserted values. Example:

```python
msg = u'Invoice %(invoice_id)d could not be voided. It is already %(invoice_status)s.' % dict(
    invoice_id=invoice.pk, invoice_status=invoice.get_status_display().lower()
)
```

is much better than:

```python
msg = u'Invoice %d could not be voided. It is already %s.' % (
    invoice.pk, invoice.get_status_display().lower()
)
```

* As little HTML inside {% blocktrans %} as possible. Some HTML can't be avoided
  though. Use string interpolation in code to "inject" the translation string
  into a wrapping html tag:

```python
{
    'description: u'<p style="margin-left:0; padding-left:0; margin-top:1em; width:75%%;">%s</p>' % _(
        u'In-depth information about your project should be put in this section. '
        u'Use the Background, Project plan, Current status and Sustainability fields '
        u'to tell people more about the project.'
    )
}
```

Here is also shown the use of python's automatic concatenation of multiple
single line strings into one long string.

* Translation in RSR (in JSX) is done in the following manner:

  - In the JSX views we encapsulate strings in this manner `t('Program overview')`.
  - Then, periodically we collect these strings by going to `cd
    akvo/rsr/spa/translations` and run `node extract.js` while docker
    is running.
  - This will populate the file `strings.py` with the new strings to be added.
  - The entire content of this file then should be manually added to
    `akvo/rsr/views/translations.py`.

### Note for translators

If the referenced document is a .html file or it's obvious that the text is used
in a web context (tags in the text is a giveaway) all extra whitespace can be
ignored, particularly \n (newline) and \t (tab) characters that may appear in
certain cases. However in a few cases, e.g. email templates formatting of this
type may be relevant. Those files usually end in .txt

## FAQ

##### Q: How do I migrate or get a Django shell?

You can `exec` commands on the web host. `docker-compose exec web python
manage.py shell` for example.


##### Q: How do I access a partnersite?

You will need to add an entry to your `/etc/hosts` file (or Windows equivalent),
and point `<partner_hostname>.localakvoapp.org` to `127.0.0.1` - for example,
add this line to be able to access the EUTF partner site:

```
127.0.0.1 eutf.localakvoapp.org
```

##### Q: How do I update the Python package dependencies?

To temporarily install additional packages in the docker machine, you can run
`docker-compose exec web pip install <package_name>`. Note that this
installation is temporary, and all changes are lost when `docker-compose down`
is run.

To install add a new dependency, add it to `requirements.txt`.


##### Q: I get a 502! Why?

Ensure that RSR is running. Chances are, a 502 means that no RSR app is running.


##### Q: How do create a copy of the test/live DB for local testing?

See the instructions in the
[restore-elephantsql-dump-to-dev-env.sh](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr/blob/develop/scripts/data/restore-elephantsql-dump-to-dev-env.sh#L3)
file.

## Helpful notes

* When you are done developing, run `docker-compose down` to stop and remove
  containers, networks, images, and volumes.

* Run `docker-compose exec web /bin/bash` to get a shell on the docker web host.

* The `akvo-rsr` repository from your local machine is synced to the virtual
  machine, and the RSR application will restart when you make code changes.

## Useful scripts

There are a variety of useful scripts in `scripts/devhelpers`.
